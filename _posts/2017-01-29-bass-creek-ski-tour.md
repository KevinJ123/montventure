In January I took advantage of our two car family status to do a ski tour up Bass Creek in the Bitterroots. In recent years I’ve spent most of my ski days at the resort with the family. It’s been wonderful teaching my children to ski but I’ve missed the peacefulness of being out in the woods in the wintertime. This past winter I got out for a few ski tours and Bass Creek was the highlight. I left Missoula very early, started skiing up the canyon before first light and ended up making it all the way to ridge between the Bass Creek drainage and the South Fork of Lolo Creek. It was a beautiful blue sky day and the highlights were skiing over the frozen Bass Lake and making sublime turns on the open slopes above the lake. I’m looking forward to doing more long mellow ski tours when the snow flies again.
