Last night we broke curfew to go out and watch the sunset.  Instead of pajamas and books we sauntered up to the "L" on Mount Jumbo. The sun set a little after 9, when the solstice comes around next month it will be about 30 minutes later.  This time of year it feels like we are on the upside of a grand celestial deal where we give up light and warmth in the winter months for exchange for long glorious days in the summer.  The high elevation snow is quickly receding and the light has returned.  It's time to start planning summer adventures. The children both fell asleep on the car ride home which shortcut the typical "go back to bed" routine resulting in an effective bedtime not all that different from some of our more typical evenings.
