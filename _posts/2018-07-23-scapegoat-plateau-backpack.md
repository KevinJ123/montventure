For our 3rd annual father daughter backpack Audrey and I headed to the Scapegoat Wilderness with food for five days and a plan to hike alongside and hopefully up onto the Scapegoat plateau. The highlands of the plateau hover around 8,000 feet high, are guarded by towering vertical cliffs, and capped by Scapegoat Mountain.

We started from the Crown Mountain trailhead and made quick progress on a good trail up to the pass. On the far side of the pass we soon entered an expansive burn area that we walked through for the rest of the day and next morning. The trail on the far side of the pass was less traveled and disappeared in places but was always easy to spot again a short ways down the valley. The burned trees offered little shade but we found the biggest tree around and took a nice break in its shadow scooting over periodically as the tree shadow migrated like a giant sundial.

We camped along Straight Creek near the junction with the Cigarette Rock trail having not seen another person for the entire day. The sun was slow to reach the damp creek bottom in the morning and it took us a little while to get moving. However, I could already see the sun lighting up Cigarette Rock far above, our first objective for the day and hopefully, giving us easy access to the Scapegoat Plateau. The trail was impossible to follow through the creek bottom so we used a GPS track to guide our way up the gentle slope and soon spotted the trail. It was quickly apparent from the many downed trees that the trail gets little use. Audrey and I did our part by clearing the smaller branches and trees that were moveable. The burned deadfall wood was surprisingly light making us feel really strong as we pitched trees down the hill. As we approached open slopes below Cigarette Rock the trail disappeared and I thought we would have to find out own route the rest of the way. Surprisingly, a good track reappeared in the trees on the upper slopes and we followed it right up to the ridge and our first view of the Scapegoat Plateau and the dramatic cliffs of Flint Mountain guarding the northern edge.

An established path continued straight ahead taking the easiest route to the plateau highlands. We left the user path and climbed the gentle slope to the top of Cigarette Rock to take in the views. I had mapped out a route traversing the ridge southwest of Cigarette Rock and then dropping down onto the Plateau. Audrey was willing to try it so we descended to a small muddy pond and then climbed steeply onto the ridge. The ridge walking was sublime with excellent views of the plateau, cliffs, Scapegoat Mountain and distant peaks in every direction. It was windy, but sunny and warm. My biggest concern about the ridge was descending the steep slopes at the end down to the plateau. As we rounded the final high point I was quite relieved to see that it was steep but walkable. We descended carefully and soon were walking on a flat surface of limestone peppered with chunks of rock left behind from layers eroded away long ago. Audrey commented that the expansive rock surface reminded her of our trips to Moab.

My first priority was to find water. There were snowfields but we had already encountered places where the snow melted and seeped right into the porous ground. We soon found a large snowfield with a modest stream of water than ran a short ways and then dropped into a crack in the limestone and disappeared. We filled out bottles and walked along the base of the hill finding many more locations where water was running. But each time when the stream reached the rock it soon dropped down some hole or crack and disappeared.

We setup our tent in a beautiful meadow surrounded on three sides by small trees to help protect us from the wind. We found a nice place to sit and made dinner overlooking the Green Fork Canyon cliffs and Scapegoat Mountain. Audrey helped me to hang the food that night. She tried a couple times underhand (my preferred approach) then tried overhand and threw it over the branch on her first try. After dinner I convinced Audrey to walk a little ways up to a ridge behind our tent to watch the sunset. She kindly agreed despite having already spent a lot of time on her feet that day. We walked trough meadows, found an old user trail, danced over rocks to avoid some mud, and walked up a small snowfield on our way to the ridge. It was quite windy but the we caught a last bit of sunshine before it dropped behind Flint Mountain and got to gaze at the sun painted slopes of Scapegoat Peak.

The sun rose early and made for an enjoyable breakfast in the meadow outside our tent. Audrey took to packing her own backpack this year, a task that I had mostly done in years past. She started pitching in on other tasks too, like setting up the tent, and it really made us more efficient at braking camp each morning and setting up each night. We walked a short ways to the nearest disappearing stream and loaded up our water bottles for the day. I pulled out a headlamp and we took turns sticking our heads down the hole to see where the water went. The stream ran a short ways along a rock surface and then disappeared down a crack. While Audrey was taking her turn I spotted some movement on the rocky slope above us and looked up to see a bull elk descending form higher on the mountain. He was quickly followed by another one and they both disappeared into the trees likely heading to one of the other streams for some water.

The walk across the plateau to the gentle slopes of Scapegoat Mountain was a highlight of the trip. We strolled through fields of grass and small flowers occasionally passing a sinkhole with a remnant from the winter snowpack hiding in the shadows at the bottom. We walked along what appeared to be the best route but found ourselves at the top of some small broken cliff bands that could have easily been avoided if we had stayed more to the north. Instead of backtracking we managed to pick our way down without much difficulty and then proceeded to climb onto the western ridge of Scapegoat Mountain. On the way up to the ridge a bird surprised me flying up from right near my feet. I looked down to see where it came from and spotted a small hole in the ground containing a nest and a clutch of eggs. I pointed it out to Audrey and we moved on quickly to allow the bird to return to her eggs.

The approach to Scapegoat Mountain is a long gentle walk up from the west with a small scree ramp providing easy access to the summit. I was quite surprised when my head crested the top to see a bleached big horn sheep skull with a complete pair of horns "staring" right at me. Someone had placed it well. From the top mountains receded into the distance in every direction except to the east where beyond ridges and hills the plains of the Rocky Mountain Front were visible in the distance. Far below the cliffs I could see the trail that we would walk along the next day.

Audrey was justifiably concerned about our planned descent route down into the Green Fork valley. I knew there was an established "climbers" trail that traversed above a section of cliffs to reach a more gentle slope that allowed for a safe descent to the valley floor. However, I had read a report from a couple years earlier that described a section of the traverse that had eroded out creating a treacherous no-fall zone. I had told Audrey that if it looked too dangerous we would have to backtrack and return down the Cigarette Mountain trail.

As we descended toward the cliffs cairns appeared helping guide the way and we could spot the dirt track on the valley wall. Thankfully, when we reached the high traverse the trail was well worn-in from use over the last couple of years. It was not dangerous, but certainly kept us focused. In places the trail traversed a steep earthen slope that funneled into a drop over the cliff below. A stumble here could end badly. We proceeded carefully and were soon dropped down a steep slope, crossed a creek, and rejoined an official trail. We made good time walking down the Green Fork valley and took a short side trip to swim in a small unnamed lake. Waterfalls were emanating from the cliff walls in the distance making a dramatic demonstration of what happens to all the water that disappears into the ground on the plateau.

From the lake we climbed up a trail heading for Halfmoon Basin. After a long day on our feet the climb up to the ridge seemed to drag on. But we were both in good spirits and were rewarded with views of the vertical cliff walls as we descended down to Halfmoon Creek. This is a popular area and I thought we would encounter our first people of the trip but was quite surprised to find the established camp sites all empty. We found a quiet place by the creek and made dinner before deciding if we would camp or continue farther up the trail. We took our time eating, re-filled our water, and then decided to walk a bit more. With dinner done and full water bottles we were free to camp anywhere that looked like a nice spot. We left the creek and entered a burned area where the trees were completely absent allowing for great views of the Halfmoon Park cliffs with the sun about to descending behind them. Just short of the pass we spotted an amazing site in a small meadow just below the cliffs. The area was surrounded by burned snags but with our tent in the middle of the little clearing it was unlikely that any of them would reach us if they fell. It was a warm and breezy night and we both slept well.

Each morning we seemed to get more efficient with packing up and getting started. This morning we decided to start walking and take a break for breakfast down the trail. From the pass right above our campsite we had excellent views of the cliff walls in both directions. We passed a junction for the Dearborn river trail and found a pleasant rock in the sunshine to have breakfast and coffee. We took our time but when we started packing up to go Audrey gave me a hard time for taking so long with my backpack. I finally pulled it together and then quickly jumped up to strap my pack on as fast as could. As soon as I was finished I said to Audrey, "WHAT IS TAKING YOU SO LONG?", and we both got a good laugh out of it.

As the trail turned toward the north to circle around a ridge we had excellent views of the plateau cliffs capped by Scapegoat Mountain. We stopped several times to take pictures and it seemed like each spot was better than the last. We stopped to take a short break and consult the map. We soon discovered the junction with the Cave Creek trail was near and then looked up and  spotted a solo backpacker heading down it a short distance away. He was the first person we had seen in three days but his back was to us and as far as we know he did not know we were there.

The area around the Cave Creek trail had the best wildflowers we had seen on the trip. We stopped to take pictures and Audrey tried to stalk the butterflies to capture close up shots. We descended steadily we good views of Dearborn River valley below us and an unnamed red rock peak with green forested slopes across the valley.

We reached the Dearborn River and followed the valley for three miles to the Welcome Creek ranger station. I really enjoy the protected river bottoms in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex. Most wilderness areas protect the high peaks but the valley bottoms are developed. When walking along rivers in the Bob I feel like I've stepped back in time and imagine what it was like to walk along the banks of the Clark Fork River before the city of Missoula grew up around it. As we made our way down the river Audrey spotted the largest patch of ripe wild strawberries I have ever seen. She dropped to her knees and crawled along eating every bright red berry she could find. Other than color wild strawberries bear little resemblance the gargantuan supermarket version. But what they lack in size they make up for in taste. When Audrey had her fill we moved along and soon reached the Welcome Creek ranger station and left the Dearborn River trail to begin our ascent to Welcome Pass.

Welcome Pass came quickly and we left the Scapegoat Wilderness and headed down the Jakie Creek trail. The trail is this section was deeply eroded and in many places the huge ruts had been filled in with cut-up deadfall trees. A new trail had formed next to the ruts but it was awkward and difficult to follow at times. We reached a boggy area where all the trees surrounding the water had died and the trail ahead was covered with thick mud. It was clear that recently the water in the small pond had been much higher. The trail must have been under several feet of water. We moved along steadily enjoying the views of the new terrain surrounding us.

After a long descent we took a break at a crossing of Jakie Creek and decided to go ahead and make dinner. We had been on our feet a long time and it felt good to sit by the cool water. We saved our cookies for later and headed down the trail looking for a place to spend the night. We followed Smith Creek staying high above the water as the creek flowed through a beautiful canyon. Our search for a campsite became more urgent as the evening waned. We scoped out a couple of spots, including one with a great view looking back up the canyon at a waterfall, but the vegetation was stiff and there were many small prickers. As we continued on we crossed a section of private land and based on that I thought I had us located on the map.  However, when we spotted a sign for the Ford Creek trail I realized we were further along than I thought. We had reached the point where we would leave the creek and begin a climb heading back to the Benchmark road. We soon found a great camping spot on a bluff above the creek and quickly setup our tent then took a break sitting in the grass eating cookies and enjoying the moonrise and alpenglow on the peaks above the green valley. Sleep came easy and soon the sun was returning and we started our last day.

We both woke early ready to get on the trail and complete our 5 day loop. Just before we started walking I glanced across the valley and spotted a group of 8 backpackers moving along an old road bench. They were pretty far away and I doubt that they saw us. We shouldered our packs and walked up through open forests and wide grassy meadows dotted with wildflowers. As we gained elevation there were some views of Crown Mountain, nothing like the expansive views from our days up on the plateau. But the pleasant walking and warm sunshine made for an enjoyable morning. Soon we reached the low pass and started an efficient descent to the Double Falls campground. When we reached the campground there was no bridge over the creek and we had to wade through the water one last time.

Surprisingly, the Double Falls campground was empty. I could hear water rushing through the trees and we took a slight diversion to check out the falls before heading up to the road to walk back to our car. Double Falls was bigger than I expected and did indeed consist of two stair step cascades living up to its name. Neither of us were looking forward to the final mile on the dusty Benchmark road. Audrey had saved two precious energy chews for the final mile. One for each of us. We decided to each put one in our mouth and not chew it until we reached the car. It takes a bit of concentration to keep yourself from automatically chewing and that slight distraction coupled with the challenged of finishing before it dissolved helped speed us along the road. Soon we reached the car, took off our packs, and broke into the can of Pringles and package of Oreos we had stashed.

Audrey and I had an amazing trip and wonderful time together. Audrey has come a long ways since we started doing these trips two years ago. She can now move at a good pace all day long. I'm already thinking about ideas for next summer!
