Nine Years ago I crossed over Blodgett pass during the run leg of Joshua's MESSS (Missoula Elk Summit Shit Show) event. An elegant idea by someone who spends a lot of time looking at maps to cross the Bitterroot Mountains from Elk Summit in Idaho to Blodgett Canyon near Hamilton, MT. Blodgett pass was the half-way point of a trail marathon following some bike shenanigans. I had never been in Blodgett canyon before that day and my first look was from the pass crossing from Idaho back into Montana. We took a break at the pass, ate some snacks, rested our legs, and I gazed up longingly at the sweeping layers of granite above. I wanted to wander up and walk around on that rock. But with 13 miles to go and a small running pack it was not an option. When I finally reached the Blodgett trailhead after dark Julie and the kids we're waiting for me. Zach had just turned one. In August I finally returned to Blodgett Pass. This time Zach joined me just a few weeks before his 10th birthday.

This time we had backpacks and my hope was we could wander around no that sweeping granite and if maybe even summit Blodgett Mountain. Blodgett Canyon, like the other major Bitterroot drainages, is long. But it has a good trail and climbs gradually. We would take one day to hike up the canyon and setup a basecamp near the trail to the pass, one day scrambling around in the high country, and then hike back out on the third day.

In the first few miles we encountered a few other groups taking in the sights of the lower canyon and day hiking to the waterfalls. We took a long break above the first falls at a spot where the creek flows over bare rock. Zach took off his shoes and waded in tentatively but was soon dancing around in the water. The second waterfall made another nice diversion from the trail. We wandered up the rock walking where it was dry and jumping over small side streams. Past the second falls the trail pulls away from the stream and there are more trees blocking the views of the canyon walls and surrounding peaks. The vegetation was thicker and slower going, especially for Zach. However, long swaths of this vegetation was thimbleberry bushes covered in ripe berries that were the best I had ever tasted. Our progressed slowed and I began to worry about making it to our camp before dark. But it was hard to resist all the berries so close at hand. We spent the night in an established site on the edge of Nine-Mile Meadow. Our chosen tent site turned out to be right under a tree branch and we were able to hang our pyramid tent by a line and forego the center pole making the inside feel palatial, especially with just the two of us.

In the morning, with our basecamp established, we got an early start heading up the trail toward Blodgett Pass. The creek was easily accessible near the trail junction just before we started to head up and I loaded up on water not expecting to find any the rest of the day. Zach was really excited about the rock scrambling and wanted to leave the trail before we even got to the pass and head straight up the rock. It did look like fun, but also a bit steep. I was able to assuage him with promises of plenty of scrambling opportunities above the pass.

After a couple more switchbacks we reached the pass and the uprising swath of granite was much as I remembered from my previous trip only a fair bit steeper. We headed up the stair-step ridge going west towards Blodgett Mountain. Zach and I both really enjoyed the scrambling and the views that were already good from the pass opened up more as we gained elevation. After ascending a few rocky pitches the slope mellowed and there were trees on the ridge that slowed our progress. Zach enthusiasm wained and we stopped to take a break and talk about our options. At this point we were at least 14 miles from the the trailhead. If we turned around we'd have to go back to camp and hang out for the afternoon because it was too far for us to hike out that day. Zach decided to continue heading up and we moved onto crossing an open cirque below the peak.

On the far side of the cirque there was a break in Blodgett's southern ridge with a scree ramp that looked like it would provide us access to the top. We had to cross a large boulder field first. This was not easy but Zach really enjoyed the hands-on bouldering and micro-route finding. We reached the ramp and slowly made our way up to the ridge. The views of Blodgett  Blodgett lake perched up in a rocky half-bowl with the peaks of the southern Bitterroot in the background was astounding. From the ridge it was a mellow walk up to the peak where we were greeted with views of peaks in every direction and a bird's-eye view of the massive Blodgett Canyon extending all the way back to the Bitterroot Valley with the Sapphire Range far in the distance. It was a beautiful day and we took our time on the peak checking out the scenery in every direction. The Idaho side looked like a particular interesting place to explore. That area is a long way from everywhere and likely sees very few human visitors.

The trip down was slow going at times but certainly physically easier than the climb up. Zach discovered his inner mountain goat on the descent hopping from rock to rock at an impressive speed and rarely missing a step. We made our way to a large patch of snow and enjoyed a mellow glissade and a short break from rock hopping. We took a more southerly route across the cirque on the return avoiding some of the boulders and some of the treed ridge. Scrambling down the final rock sections went quickly with Zach often running ahead.

It was easy hike down and back to camp. We enjoyed a well earned dinner and then headed into the tent for the evening. I actually look forward to the long nights on backpacking trips. Without the distractions of home there is not much to do except go to sleep. There was still light in the sky when we laid down in our sleeping bags and we talked for a while. During this time we heard hoofed animals in the area around our camp. We never saw them but after having similar experiences in Jewel Basin I'm certain it was mountain goats that had come down from the higher elevations in the evening. Just as our eyes were getting heavy we heard a very loud SQUWAK SQUWAK SQUWAK followed immediately by a rush of hooves and then WHAM! something hit our tent and I immediately yelled out to scare away away whatever it was. Now we were both wide awake and Zach asked me if he should be scared. It took me a couple of minutes to come up with a reasonable explanation of what had happened. I think a goat got too close to a sleeping bird. The bird squawked loudly which sent the goat running. It must have run right by our tent and clipped a guy line with its foot which made a loud sound and made me think something had hit the tent.

After that we both feel asleep but the excitement for the night was not over. In the middle of the night I was awoken by a loud thunderstorm moving overhead followed by heavy rain. I was surprised as this was certainly not in the forecast I checked before we left but was happy to warm and dry in a solid tent.
