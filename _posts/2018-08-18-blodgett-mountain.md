title: Blodgett Mountain

Nine Years ago I crossed over Blodgett pass during the run leg of Joshua's MESSS (Missoula Elk Summit Shit Show) event. A brilliant idea by someone who spends a lot of time looking at maps to cross the Bitterroot Mountains from Elk Summit in Idaho to Blodgett Canyon near Hamilton, MT. Blodgett pass was the half-way point of a trail marathon following some bike shenanigans. I had never been in Blodgett canyon before that event and my first look was from the pass crossing from Idaho back into Montana. We took a break at the pass, ate some snacks, rested our legs, and I gazed up longingly at the sweeping layers of granite above. I wanted to wander up and walk on that rock, but with 13 miles to go and a small running pack it was not an option. When I finally reached the Blodgett trailhead after dark Julie and the kids we're waiting for me. Zach had just turned two.

In August, I finally returned to Blodgett Pass and Zach joined me, just a couple of weeks
