Nine Years ago I crossed over Blodgett pass during the run leg of Joshua's MESSS (Missoula Elk Summit Shit Show) event. An elegant idea by someone who spends a lot of time looking at maps to cross the Bitterroot Mountains from Elk Summit in Idaho to Blodgett Canyon near Hamilton, MT. Blodgett pass was the half-way point of a trail marathon following some bike shenanigans. I had never been in Blodgett canyon before that day and my first look was from the pass crossing from Idaho back into Montana. We took a break at the pass, ate some snacks, rested our legs, and I gazed up longingly at the sweeping layers of granite above. I wanted to wander up and walk around on that rock. But with 13 miles to go and a small running pack it was not an option. When I finally reached the Blodgett trailhead after dark Julie and the kids we're waiting for me. Zach had just turned one. In August I finally returned to Blodgett Pass. This time Zach joined me just a few weeks before his 10th birthday.

This time we had backpacks and my hope was we could wander around no that sweeping granite and if maybe even summit Blodgett Mountain. Blodgett Canyon, like the other major Bitterroot drainages, is long. But it has a good trail and climbs gradually. We would take one day to hike up the canyon and setup a basecamp near the trail to the pass, one day scrambling around in the high country, and then hike back out on the third day.

In the first few miles we encountered some other groups taking in the sights of the lower canyon and day hiking to the waterfalls. We took a long break above the first falls at a spot where the creek flows over bare rock. Zach took off his shoes and waded in tentatively but was soon dancing around in the water. The second waterfall made another nice diversion from the trail. We wandered up the rock walking where it was dry and jumping over small side streams. Past the second falls the trail pulls away from the stream and there are more trees blocking the views of the canyon walls and surrounding peaks. The vegetation was thicker and slower going, especially for Zach. However, long swaths of this vegetation was thimbleberry bushes covered in ripe berries that were the best I had ever tasted. Our progressed slowed and I began to worry about making it to our camp before dark. But it was hard to resist all the berries so close at hand. We spent the night in an established site on the edge of Nine-Mile Meadow. Our chosen tent site turned out to be right under a tree branch and we were able to hang our pyramid tent by a line and forego the center pole making the inside feel palatial, especially with just the two of us.

In the morning, with our basecamp established, we got an early start heading up the trail toward Blodgett Pass. The creek was easily accessible near the trail junction just before we started to head up and I loaded up on water not expecting to find any the rest of the day. Zach was really excited about the rock scrambling and wanted to leave the trail before we even got to the pass and head straight up the rock. It did look like fun, but also a bit steep. I was able to assuage him with promises of plenty of scrambling opportunities above the pass.
